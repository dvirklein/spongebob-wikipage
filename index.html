        <p class="main-pargraph"><u>SpongeBob SquarePants</u> (born/created July 14, 1986) is the main
        character of the Nickelodeon animated series of the same name. He was
        designed by the former marine biologist, Stephen Hillenburg. Hillenburg
        based SpongeBob on Bob the Sponge, a character he had created for his
        educational book "The Intertidal Zone" in the late 1980s. SpongeBob is a
        childish and joyful sea sponge who lives in a pineapple with his pet
        snail Gary in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. He works as a fry
        cook at the Krusty Krab, a job which he is exceptionally skilled at and
        enjoys thoroughly. He attends Mrs. Puff's Boating School, and his
        greatest dream in life is to receive his boating license. Unfortunately,
        he tenses up whenever he has to drive a boatmobile, and he drives
        recklessly. SpongeBob is very good-natured and loves to hang out with
        his best friend Patrick. His teacher is Mrs. Puff and his boss is Mr.
        Krabs.</p>

        <p class="main-pargraph"><u>Patrick Star</u> is one of the ten main characters in the SpongeBob
        SquarePants franchise. He is SpongeBob's best friend as well as one of
        his two neighbors. He is a naïve and overweight pink sea star. He is
        voiced by Bill Fagerbakke and first appears in the pilot episode, "Help
        Wanted." He lives under a rock in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom.
        SpongeBob and Squidward are his two neighbors, and, when viewed on the
        front side, are to the right of his residence. Both he and SpongeBob
        like to bother Squidward; though they do it unknowingly and have good
        intentions. He is the son of Herb and Margie Star and the younger
        brother of Sam Star.</p>

        <p class="main-pargraph"><u>Squidward J. Q.Tentacles</u>
        is one of the ten main characters of the SpongeBob SquarePants
        franchise.He is SpongeBob's grumpy neighbor and coworker who lives in an
        Easter Island head. He is an arrogant artist and musician, and his
        favorite hobbies are painting self-portraits and playing the clarinet.
        Even though Squidward's name contains the word squid, he is an octopus,
        not a squid, as confirmed in many interviews and episodes. He has the
        traits of an octopus—a round bulbous head and rectangular pupils—while a
        squid has a long triangular head and circular eyes, unlike Squidward.
        Squids have ten limbs, many more than Squidward. The series' animators
        believed that giving him eight limbs would be too burdensome and
        difficult to animate, which is why he is usually depicted with six
        limbs. Notable exceptions are brief scenes in "Pressure" and "Sold!," in
        which he has a full set of eight legs. In "Feral Friends," his exact
        species is identified: a giant Pacific octopus. He is a very cynical,
        selfish, stick-in-the-mud individual. He works as the cashier at the
        Krusty Krab, a job he hates. Squidward is frequently annoyed by
        SpongeBob's loud and cheerful behavior, but he sometimes sticks up for
        SpongeBob and sees him as a friend on occasion.</p>

        <p class="main-pargraph"><u>Eugene Harold Krabs</u>
        more commonly known as Mr. Krabs, is one of the ten main characters in
        the SpongeBob SquarePants franchise. He is a red crab who lives in an
        anchor with his daughter, Pearl, who is a young whale. He is the owner
        and founder of the Krusty Krab restaurant as well as the employer of
        both SpongeBob and Squidward. Mr. Krabs was designed by Stephen
        Hillenburg, a marine biology teacher. Hillenburg often received fan
        letters that asked why Pearl is a whale while her father is a crab.
        Hillenburg simply wanted each member of the main cast to be a different
        animal. Mr. Krabs' most prominent trait is his obsession with money,
        meaning he's also obsessed with wealth, to the point where he
        occasionally treats money and wealth better than his daughter and
        employees. Mr. Krabs' only business competition comes from the Chum
        Bucket, a failing restaurant run by Sheldon Plankton and his wife Karen.
        Plankton and Karen are constantly scheming to steal the Krabby Patty
        secret formula that makes the Krusty Krab so successful.</p>

        <p class="main-pargraph"><u>Pearl Krabs</u>
        is one of the ten main characters in the SpongeBob SquarePants
        franchise. She is a young whale who lives in a hollow anchor with her
        father Mr. Krabs. When Pearl grows up, Mr. Krabs wants her to continue
        the family business by inheriting the Krusty Krab and becoming its
        owner. She is voiced by Lori Alan. Pearl was the second main character
        that Stephen Hillenburg created for the show. He was inspired to design
        her while working as a supervisor for whale watches at the Ocean
        Institute. Hillenburg often received letters that asked why Pearl is a
        whale while her father is a crab. The answer is simple: Hillenburg
        wanted each member of the main cast to be a different animal. The
        in-universe difference in species between Pearl and Mr. Krabs has never
        been addressed in an episode, but the official trivia book states that
        Pearl takes after her unseen mother, who was also a whale. Stephen
        Hillenburg was strongly against revealing the identity of Pearl's mom
        and kept it a secret throughout the show.</p>

        <p class="main-pargraph"><u>Sandra Jennifer "Sandy" Cheeks</u>
        is one of the ten main characters in the SpongeBob SquarePants
        franchise. She is an American squirrel from the surface who wears a
        diving suit and lives in an air-filled glass treedome to survive
        underwater. She is voiced by Carolyn Lawrence. Sandy is a thrill seeker
        who loves extreme sports and karate. Having come from the state of
        Texas, she has a Southern drawl and a love for rodeos. She works as a
        scientist and built both her treedome and air suit herself. She is also
        a member of the Gal Pals along with Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl.</p>

        <p class="main-pargraph"><u>Sheldon J. Plankton</u>
        more commonly known as Plankton, is one of the ten main characters of
        the SpongeBob SquarePants franchise. He is a planktonic copepod who runs
        the Chum Bucket restaurant alongside Karen, a waterproof computer who is
        his sidekick and wife. The Chum Bucket is highly unpopular in Bikini
        Bottom because it serves chum, a type of bait made from fish meat. Both
        Plankton and Karen are the two main villains of the franchise. Plankton
        despises his rival, Mr. Krabs, for running a successful restaurant
        because his own business rarely gets any customers. He is incredibly
        jealous of Mr. Krabs and his success. His main goal is to steal Krabs'
        secret formula for Krabby Patties and running Mr. Krabs out of business.
        Karen gives him a variety of plans to steal it, but their efforts always
        end up failing in the process. Plankton is voiced by Mr. Lawrence, one
        of the show's staff writers. Stephen Hillenburg originally planned for
        Plankton and Karen to be one-time characters, but Lawrence wrote them
        into many episodes and proved that they could work as the main villains.
        Both Plankton and Karen first appear in the episode "Plankton!" Plankton
        succeeds at stealing the formula in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, but
        his goal of world domination is eventually thwarted by SpongeBob. In
        "Friend or Foe," it is revealed that Mr. Krabs and Plankton were best
        friends during their childhood, but a dispute over the Krabby Patty
        secret formula ended their friendship for real, meaning that Plankton
        had a part in the creation of the Krabby Patty.</p>

        <p class="main-pargraph" ><u>Karen Plankton</u> birthday: December 20 is one of the ten main
        characters in the SpongeBob SquarePants franchise. She is a waterproof
        supercomputer who lives in the Chum Bucket laboratory. She is Plankton's
        wife and sidekick who supplies him with evil plans to steal the Krabby
        Patty formula. Along with Plankton, she is one of the two main villains
        of the show. Both Karen and Plankton first appear in the episode
        "Plankton!" As a computer, Karen is the smartest resident of Bikini
        Bottom and has a clever, analytical personality. She has two main forms:
        a big monitor on the wall or a portable wheeled computer. Along with her
        role as co-owner of the Chum Bucket, she works as the chef and cashier.
        She rarely has to fulfill these jobs due to the restaurant's
        unpopularity. Karen was named after Karen Hillenburg, the wife of the
        show's creator, Stephen Hillenburg. She is voiced by Jill Talley, who is
        married to SpongeBob's voice actor, Tom Kenny.</p>

        <p class="main-pargraph"><u>Mrs. Poppy Puff</u> is one of the ten main characters in the
        SpongeBob SquarePants franchise. She is SpongeBob's teacher at Boating
        School, where she teaches students how to drive boats like underwater
        cars. She is a paranoid pufferfish who wears a sailor uniform. She is
        voiced by Mary Jo Catlett. Teaching and driving are her passions in
        life. She is talented at both, having successfully taught every student
        other than SpongeBob how to drive. She and SpongeBob are always on an
        "endless quest" to get him a driver's license, but due to his reckless
        boating skills, they never succeed. Her boating school is the only one
        in the ocean and is very popular. Mrs. Puff's school is attached to a
        submerged lighthouse and surrounded by a stunt-driving course. Stephen
        Hillenburg called Mrs. Puff the "most important" character to the show's
        history, saying that she "saved" the show from not being greenlit. He
        created her as a new main character in 1997, shortly after he pitched
        SpongeBob to Nickelodeon. The network gave him a strict order: they
        would only produce the show if SpongeBob was a kid who went to school.
        Hillenburg was ready to "walk out" on Nickelodeon because writing
        SpongeBob as a school-age child went against his creative vision.
        However, he came up with Mrs. Puff and her Boating School as a
        compromise, allowing SpongeBob to attend school as an adult. Because
        Hillenburg began his career as a marine science teacher, Mrs. Puff was a
        personal character to him, and he channeled many of his experiences as a
        teacher into her character.</p>

        <p class="main-pargraph"><u>Garold "Gary" Wilson, Jr.</u> is SpongeBob SquarePants's pet sea
        snail and the most seen pet in the series. He lives with SpongeBob in
        his pineapple house on 124 Conch Street. Gary is voiced by Tom Kenny and
        first appears in the pilot episode, "Help Wanted." He is a domesticated
        house pet with similar mannerisms to a cat, most notably his "meow"
        sound, as snails are the underwater equivalent to cats in the show. It
        has been suggested that SpongeBob has had Gary ever since he was a young
        boy. The episode "Treats!" reveals that Gary was adopted by SpongeBob.
        In "Plankton's Pet" SpongeBob reveals to have bought Gary at the animal
        shelter. Gary was created as a minor joke character that would appear in
        the background of SpongeBob's bedroom, just like SpongeBob's pet scallop
        Shelley. However, as the series progressed, Gary developed a personality
        of his own beyond just saying "meow." He was eventually added to the
        show's Main Model Pack on March 22, 2000 and became one of the ten main
        characters.</p>
